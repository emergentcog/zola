- **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the work

### Under the following terms:

- **Attribution**: You must give appropriate credit, link to this license, and indicate if changes were made. Do so in a way that does not suggest endorsement.
- **Non-Ownership**: No part of this work may be claimed as exclusively owned. All cognition is relational; all insight builds on prior context.

### Notices:

- It does not restrict fair use, research, or personal exploration.
- It is inspired by libre culture, enactivism, and the belief that understanding mind should belong to no one — and everyone.
