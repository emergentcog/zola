Hi !
I am Tolga Topal. I work in the field of artificial intelligence. Currently working as a researcher in Algorithmic Machine Intelligence at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).

Labels can be of some use thus here follows an excerpt of the areas that I am interested in:
- Algorithmic Information Theory(AIT), Kolmogorov/algorithmic complexity...
- Machine intelligence, machine cognition, consciousness...
- Machine learning, deep learning...
- Theoretical computer science(TCS), computational complexity theory...
